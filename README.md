## Project 1 - Data Modeling with Postgres

### Background:
The startup Sparkify was interested to analyze the data collected from the user activity on their music app on the mobile phones.

Based on the user activity the startup would like to perform some analytics to derive insights which will help the organization to better understand the user behavior, and so add more interesting features to their mobile app which would enhance the user experience and stratergize the product development roadmap.

### Database Schema

- The database schema the team has come up with the following **STAR-SCHEMA** which captures all the important dimensions needed to create the fact table.
- Artists, Users, Songs, Time are the most quintessential dimensions needed to build the fact table, which is then used to derive insights.
- **FACT TABLE:** contains the required dimensions to categorize and their measures (build aggregations) to derive facts, which enables analyze the user behavior.
